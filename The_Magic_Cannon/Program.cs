// This is challenge work for the "C# Players Guide"
// Level 11 the Magic Cannon Challenge
// Build a simple program to create a loop fires a cannon in the following manner:
// Every 3rd crank of the cannon produces a fire bast
// Every 5th crank of the cannon produces an electric blast
// When fire and electric overlap, a combined blast is created
// All other cranks provide a normal output
// Firing should go from 1 to 100 times

//Simple themed intro for challenge
Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the cannon fire simulation program!");
Console.WriteLine("This program will crank the cannon 100 times to see what is produced");
Console.WriteLine("Press any key to begin simulation");
Console.ReadKey();
Console.Clear();
Console.WriteLine("Firing 100 simulation rounds!");
