# The_Magic_Cannon
This is a simple program for the Level 11 "The Magic Cannon" challenge in the "C# Players Guide"
Build a simple program to create a loop fires a cannon in the following manner:
Every 3rd crank of the cannon produces a fire bast
Every 5th crank of the cannon produces an electric blast
When fire and electric overlap, a combined blast is created
All other cranks provide a normal output
Firing should go from 1 to 100 time
